### Packages and Data

```{r load-packages, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse) 
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r diamon_rename}
diamonds <- diamonds %>% rename(
    depth_pct = depth,
    length_mm = x,
    width_mm = y,
    depth_mm = z,
    table_pct = table
  )
```


## Exercise 1

```{r}
# Do some preliminary investigations & cleaning

diamonds_filtered <- diamonds |> 
  filter(length_mm != 0, width_mm != 0, depth_mm != 0, na.rm = TRUE)

summary(diamonds_filtered)

```


## Exercise 2

```{r}

diamonds_filtered <- diamonds_filtered |> 
  mutate(table_mm = table_pct * width_mm / 100) 

# Overall table_mm arithmetic mean?

diamonds_filtered |> 
  summarise(
  mean(table_mm, na.rm = TRUE)
  )

# table_mm arithmetic mean within each clarity category

avg_mm_by_clarity <- diamonds_filtered |> 
  group_by(clarity) |> 
  summarise(meantab= mean(table_mm, na.rm = TRUE))

avg_mm_by_clarity


```

```{r}
# calculate the arithmetic mean across all numeric variables




```

## Exercise 3

```{r}
# Write gmean() command



```

## Exercise 4

```{r, error = TRUE}

test_data <- list(
  test1 = c(2.1, 3.8, 4.2),
  test2 = c(1, 10, 100, 1000),
  test3 = c(0, 1, 4),
  test4 = c(0.38,  0.94, -1.56),
  test5 = c(TRUE, TRUE),
  test6 = c("6", "7", "8")
)


# Create for loop to test gmean() on the above examples


```


## Exercise 5

```{r}
# Copy gmean() from Ex 3 and edit it to check the input





# Copy your code from Ex 4 to test your new command





```

## Exercise 6

```{r}
# replicate the for loop from Ex 4 using the map (or a similar) function

```


## Exercise 7

```{r}
# Overall table_mm arithmetic mean, median, and geometric mean?






# Arithmetic mean, median, and geometric mean of table_mm within each clarity category






```

## Exercise 8 (optional)

```{r}
# Create gmean2() that computes the geometric mean 
#   that uses the original definition






```


## Exercise 9 (optional)

```{r}
# Create a function that computes the harmonic mean







```

## Exercise 10 (optional)
